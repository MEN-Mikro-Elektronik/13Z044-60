 (taken from guide for MEN EM01 VxWorks BSP 10EM01-60)
------------------------------------------------------------

- WindML 5.3 for VxWorks 7 is provided as a complete source tree, located
  in a sample workspace (outside the MDIS source tree)

- the files provided in this WINDML-5.x directory are EM10A-specific
  additions to the WindML 5.3 source tree specific to the MEN EM10A;
  these files are already present at corresponding locations in the
  delivered WindML 5.3 source tree.

- to build the WindML 5.3 libraries, refer to the scripts provided with the
  delivery (including create-build-windml.bat and {create,build}-windml-*.sh)

- NOTE: the delivered UGL graphics driver for Z044 requires VxWorks 7 and is
  not backward-compatible with VxWorks 6.x
