Quick installation guide for WindML-4.x/5.x drivers 

These are the files required for building a Wind Media Library (WindML) static lib as a DKM in the Workbench.
Copy these files with exactly this directory structure under the $(WIND_BASE)/components/windml-5.x path of your VxWorks installation.

Then create a DKM project and select the 16Z044 graphics driver and 16Z031 Touch as pointing device.:

    - setup a VxWorks Downloadable Kernel Module Project (DKM) +
                   VxWorks Middleware Component +
                   WindML Component: take care to select proper resolution for your
                   16Z044 based graphics hardware or e.g. ugldemo will fail.

    - BuildSpec is PPC32 (currently the only architecture on which Z044 IP Core is used)
    - Configure Wind Media Library
    - build the DKM project
    - set the switch MEN_LINK_WINDML in the BSP Makefile target\config\men_em01\Makefile to the appropiate Workbench workspace directory where your DKM project is located

    - when the build is done, a libwindml-5.3_dyn.a archive in folder 
       <workspace>\obj\vxworks-6.9\krnl\lib\... 
      is generated which must be linked to the vxWorks.st image.
